# MD learning

A project by Jake Floyd and Rebecca Li for Data Driven Modeling taught by Prof. Paris Perdikaris.

All the data is in https://upenn.box.com/s/1ii5tte7yfuh3h48r6yflj6ottf1k1h9, and the trained sklean models are in `trained_models`. Top level contains scripts. You must have a Penn Box account in order to view the data. 


# Installation
1. Download all the `.npy` files from https://upenn.box.com/s/1ii5tte7yfuh3h48r6yflj6ottf1k1h9 and put them in `data/`.
2. Set up the python environment. Rebecca recommends using miniconda and the `enviornment.yml` file.

Then you should be able to run `shape_testing.ipynb` as a notebook.
