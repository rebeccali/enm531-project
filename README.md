# MD learning

A project by Jake Floyd and Rebecca Li for Data Driven Modeling taught by Prof. Paris Perdikaris.

All the data is in `data`, and the trained sklean models are in `trained_models`. Top level contains scripts.


# Installation
1. Download all the `.npy` files and put them in `data/`.
2. Set up the python environment. Rebecca recommends using miniconda and the `enviornment.yml` file.

Then you should be able to run `simply_mlp.ipynb` as a notebook.
